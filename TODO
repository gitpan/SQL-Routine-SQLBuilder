TODO

* Update all code files to have version numbers of format N.N.N rather than
N.NN, and the new ones will be v-strings; at the same time, add dependency on
something like only.pm, which knows how to enforce dependencies involving
v-strings.

* Update the white space of this distribution to follow some best practices. 
This includes indenting with spaces instead of tabs, and having code lines not
be longer than 80 or 78 characters.  Run through perltidy for the first time as
well (though I was very consistent before), which may alter a few other things
towards best practices.

* Convert all class objects to be of the inside-out variety rather than
hash-based, so to gain rigorous protection against external code directly
accessing our object attributes, and to avoid related maintenance problems.

* Once the above are done, announce Rosetta/SQL::Routine Developer Release #3.

* Update the list of 'standard routines' in SQLBuilder (and SQL::Routine) to
more closely reflect the SQL:2003 standard, fill other gaps.

* Any further improvements will be implemented over time as they are needed. 
See the separately released "Rosetta-Engine-Generic" and "Rosetta-Emulator-DBI"
distributions for a clue as they are the initial main dependents of the
SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder.
