TODO

* Update the white space of this distribution to follow some best
practices.  This includes having code lines not be longer than 75
characters (like the POD lines).  This and other changes will be
accomplished by running all the code files through perltidy (the first time
I ever use that program, though I was a very consistent formatter before),
which may alter a few other things towards best practices.

* Convert all class objects to be of the inside-out variety rather than
hash-based, so to gain rigorous protection against external code directly
accessing our object attributes, and to avoid related maintenance problems.

* Once the above are done, announce Rosetta/SQL::Routine Developer Release
#4.

* Update the list of 'standard routines' in SQLBuilder (and SQL::Routine)
to more closely reflect the SQL:2003 standard, fill other gaps.

* Any further improvements will be implemented over time as they are
needed. See the separately released "Rosetta-Engine-Generic" and
"Rosetta-Emulator-DBI" distributions for a clue as they are the initial
main dependents of the SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder.
