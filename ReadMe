PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 module named "SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder";
see the file lib/SQL/Routine/SQLBuilder.pm for the main documentation, which is
in POD format.  The distribution also includes a ChangeLog file to say what
changes already happened, and a TODO file to say what changes have yet to
happen.  The file INSTALL should help with installation issues.  Read below for
how to get support or keep up to date, know this distribution's dependencies, or
read the credits or copyright and license.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  You should be able to find the
newest versions at my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net", on the page called
"Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).  They can also be found on CPAN
under the author name of "DUNCAND".  

I am inclined to update the copies on my web site more often, but those
intermediate versions are more likely to have been tested less, and the modules
may be updated day by day without increasing the version numbers.  However, the
copies on CPAN are guaranteed to have unique version numbers when the module has
changed.

DEPENDENCIES

Perl Version: 5.008001

Core Modules:

	Test::More 0.47 (but only for the test suite)

Non-Core Modules: 

	Locale::KeyedText 1.03 (for error messages)
	SQL::Routine 0.58

This module doesn't require anything else.

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists, newsgroups,
or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things out on your own, or
another person whom you know has used this.  I may start a mailing list for 
support issues later, so that users of my modules can help each other with them.

CREDITS

None besides myself so far.

Linking SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder statically or dynamically with other modules is
making a combined work based on SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder.  Thus, the terms and
conditions of the GPL cover the whole combination.  As a special exception, the
copyright holders of SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder give you permission to link
SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder with independent modules, regardless of the license
terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
combined work under terms of your choice, provided that every copy of the
combined work is accompanied by a complete copy of the source code of
SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder (the version of SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder used to
produce the combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GPL plus
this exception.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
based on SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder, and which is fully useable when not linked to
SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder in any form.

Any versions of SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder that you modify and distribute must
carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any
changes, in addition to preserving this original copyright notice and other
credits.  SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder is distributed in the hope that it will be
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

While it is by no means required, the copyright holders of
SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder would appreciate being informed any time you create a
modified version of SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder that you are willing to distribute,
because that is a practical way of suggesting improvements to the standard
version.
