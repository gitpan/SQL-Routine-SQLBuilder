                       SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2005-09-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder Release 0.21.1 (SVN r808).

    * New code file versions are: SQLBuilder.pm 0.21.1 and en.pm 0.2.1.

    * Updated all POD-containing files to re-wrap any non-indented POD
    paragraphs to a 75 character width, which is 5 less than the 80
    character width they were wrapped to before.  This change should make
    it easier to copy and paste a diff or patch of this documentation into
    an email message, where it is quoted at least once, without any line
    wrapping occurring.  Likewise, these standard documentation files were
    re-wrapped to 75 characters: ReadMe, INSTALL, LGPL|GPL, Changes, TODO.

    * Revised this Changes file to replace all detail entries for releases
    0.18 thru 0.21.0 with a significant release list for the same period;
    also added references to when all 'Rosetta developer release' (#s 1-3)
    were.

    * SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder Release 0.21.0 (SVN r787), containing
    SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder 0.21.0, was released on CPAN.  This is the
    first release of this distribution and its modules for which they had
    3-part version numbers, rather than floating point version numbers.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    Rosetta/SQL-Routine developer release #3.

2005-09-01   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder Release 0.20, containing
    SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder 0.20, was released on CPAN.  This is the last
    release of this distribution and its modules for which they had
    floating point version numbers, rather than 3-part version numbers.

2005-04-03   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder Release 0.17, containing
    SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder 0.17, was released on CPAN.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    SQL-Routine/Rosetta developer release #2.

2005-03-19   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder Release 0.16, containing
    SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder 0.16, was released on CPAN; this is the first
    release of the SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder distribution.  This is the first
    release of any distribution to contain SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder, which
    was renamed from Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder.  This is the first
    release for this module where it explicitly has a version number
    matching its distribution.

2005-03-18   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta-Extensions Release 0.15, containing
    Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder 0.15, was released on CPAN; this is the
    last release of the Rosetta-Extensions distribution.  This is the last
    release of any distribution to contain Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder. 
    This is the last release for this module where it does not explicitly
    have a version number matching its distribution.

2004-08-06   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta-Extensions Release 0.06, containing
    Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder 0.06, was released on CPAN.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    Rosetta/SQL-SyntaxModel developer release #1.

2004-04-10   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta-Extensions Release 0.01, containing
    Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder 0.01, was released on CPAN; this is the
    first release of the Rosetta-Extensions distribution.  This is the
    first release of any distribution to contain
    Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder.  This is the first release of any
    distribution for which some of the existing work that became the
    SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder distribution was in the form of executable code,
    and not just design documentation.

2004-03-25   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.29 was released on CPAN.  This is the last release
    of any distribution for which all of the existing work that became the
    SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder distribution was purely in the form of design
    documentation, without executable code of any kind.

2004-03-21   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.27 was released on CPAN.  This is the first release
    of any distribution where the proposal documentation for
    SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder uses the name Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder for
    it; it was renamed from Rosetta::Engine::Common::SQLBuilder.

2004-03-08   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.26 was released on CPAN.  This is the last release
    of any distribution for which the documented name of the proposed
    module that became SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder was given the name
    Rosetta::Engine::Common::SQLBuilder.

2004-02-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.24 was released on CPAN.  This is the first release
    of any distribution where the proposal documentation for
    SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder uses the name
    Rosetta::Engine::Common::SQLBuilder for it; it was renamed from
    Rosetta::Driver::Common::SQLBuilder.

2004-02-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.23 was released on CPAN.  This is the last release
    of any distribution for which the documented name of the proposed
    module that became SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder was given the name
    Rosetta::Driver::Common::SQLBuilder.

2003-04-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.07 was released on CPAN.  This is the first release
    of any distribution to have proposal documentation that splits out SQL
    generation code into its own module, whereas prior to this the
    documentation included SQL generation as one of several functions
    performed by several distinct modules.  The proposed name for this
    module is Rosetta::Driver::Common::SQLBuilder.

2003-01-27   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.02 was released on CPAN; this is the first release
    of the Rosetta distribution.  Early versions of the design
    documentation that became the SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder distribution were
    included.

2003-01-05   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * DBIx-Portable Release 0.01 was released on CPAN; this is the only
    release of the DBIx-Portable distribution.  This is the first release
    of any distribution to contain design documentation that became the
    SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder distribution.

2002-11-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Began development on the modules which became the
    SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder distribution as their own entity that is
    separate from my application, for open-source distribution on CPAN. 
    The modules were to comprise an RDBMS-generic DB framework for any
    application to use.

    * Modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2002-07-28

    * Posted the first significant update to the second prototype, which
    added an index or cache for data that was expensive to calculate for
    each page request, and involved rewriting about a fourth of the perl
    code.

2002-06-07

    * Posted to my website the second public prototype demo of the new
    self-proprietary database driven application, whose database schema,
    user interface, feature set, and Perl application code was almost
    completely rewritten. The new version explicitly had separate modules
    for database communication and the web interface logic, with
    MySQL-specific code and database generic or data dictionary code in
    separate files, and separate files for parts of the web interface.  The
    program used the same generic CPAN modules as in the first prototype,
    DBI/MySQL and CGI::Portable.

    * This is when I started writing self-contained code components that
    were explicitly designed to enable external code that used them to work
    seamlessly on multiple database products, and hence 2002 is the start
    of my declared copyright date range for SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder.

2001-11-24

    * Posted the last update to the first prototype.

2001-07-12

    * Posted to my website the first public prototype demo of a new
    self-proprietary database driven application, which is like a cross
    between a multimedia metadata catalogue and a repository for historical
    or genealogical data.  This application contained the first prototypes
    of code that ended up in these modules.  All of this application's
    code, for database communication and web interface logic, was situated
    in a single module, with the rest of the program being more generic
    CPAN modules like DBI (and DBD for MySQL) and CGI::Portable.

2000-05-17

    * Requested MySQL database privileges on my web host so I have
    something to start developing, testing and deploying database driven
    applications on.
